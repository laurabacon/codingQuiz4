This site is a coding quiz. When the page is loaded you see 'Coding Quiz" and instructions. You should also see a button that says "Start Quiz" 
Upon clicking the button you should be taken to the first question and set of answers.
You should be able to click the radio input for each answer and it will grab the value you choose.
After all the questions are through the quiz will stop.

I was not able to figure out the timer interval or the highscore page.
